## Rideshare Demo Applciation

I will put links and references to my decisions within this README

### Step 1: Creating the Skeleton Application

For the structure of the app, I used create react app because it is a tool I am familiar with in my current role, and I know it allows for rapid prototyping and devlopment. In the interest of getting something out quickly and efficiently, I decided it was easiest to use this tool.

### Step 2: Visualizing the Data

For JSON Data I like to use a website called Code Beautify (https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer) to give me a drop down view of each row in the dataset. This has allowed me to quickly work with various API's in the past, and understand the structure of return data before I put it into a live application.

### Step 3: Wireframing

Because I don't have access too a premium subscription to an applicaiton like LucidChart, I decided to use a free software called Draw.io that will allow me to make very basic wireframes and flowcharts that I can share within this git repository. It doesn't look very professional, but I hope it demonstrates my thought process and how I quickly layout pages in terms of basic/modular elements (in this case a table and header).

### Step 4: The Docker Environment

In Progress
