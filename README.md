## Rideshare Demo Applciation

I will put links and references to my decisions within this README

### Step 1: Creating the Skeleton Application

For the structure of the app, I used create react app because it is a tool I am familiar with in my current role, and I know it allows for rapid prototyping and devlopment. In the interest of getting something out quickly and efficiently, I decided it was easiest to use this tool.

### Step 2: Wireframing

Because I don't have access too a premium subscription to an applicaiton like LucidChart, I decided to use a free software called Draw.io that will allow me to make very basic wireframes and flowcharts that I can share within this git repository.
